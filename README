                              The gbtools Package

gbtools (Genome Browser tools) is a library of common routines used by both
seqtools and zmap. It includes routines for graphics, curl and utilities.

Note that the library is not intended to be distributed on its own but as part
of seqtools or zmap and hence may not include all the necessary
licensing/copyright notices required by Sanger. If this package is to be
distributed separately then these notices should be added following whatever
Sanger software guidelines are prevalent at that time.

Currently the package is compiled as C code but this should be changed to C++
when time allows.
