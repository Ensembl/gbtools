                              The gbtools Package

gbtools (Genome Browser tools) is a library of common routines used by both
seqtools and zmap. It includes routines for graphics, curl and utilities.

Note that the library is not intended to be distributed on its own but as part
of seqtools or zmap and hence may not include all the necessary
licensing/copyright notices required by Sanger. If this package is to be
distributed separately then these notices should be added following whatever
Sanger software guidelines are prevalent at that time.

Notes:

The package is not compiled into a dynamic library but into an archive of .o
files. As such there is no need to linking flags and other such macros as
the code is compiled into .o files and then archived into a .a file.

The Makefile.am and configure.ac setup follows an example from the web:

https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Libtool-Convenience-Libraries.html

it is hopefully about as simple as it can be.
